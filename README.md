# WordleHelper -> written in python

This program will help you solve the wordle of the day. The program score's words from a list of ~15,000 5-letter words. Each letter is counted how many times it appears in each index, and then each word's score is the sum of the letter's occurrence's in each index of that word. After each iteration, the program will return the highest ranking word that remains in the list of words.
